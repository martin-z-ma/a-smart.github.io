### Biography
Dr. Martin Ma (martin.ma@singaporetech.edu.sg) is an Assistant Professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). Prior to joining SIT, he was a Research Scientist at New Mexico Tech and a Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alberta (Canada) in 2018, followed by postdoctoral appointments at the University of Alberta, Stanford University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Over the past 14 years, Dr. Ma has applied advanced computational methods, optimization algorithms, machine learning models, numerical simulation, and software development to address challenging problems in science and engineering. His research spans energy production process optimization, decarbonization and clean energy generation, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and environmental risk mitigation.

He has served as principal investigator or co-principal investigator on numerous projects in Canada and the United States. His portfolio includes U.S. Department of Energy sponsored efforts such as the SimCCS Development and Applications program, the Science Informed Machine Learning for Accelerating Real Time Decisions in Subsurface Applications (SMART) initiative, and the Consortium Advancing Technology for Assessment of Lost Oil & Gas Wells (CATALOG) program. As co PI, he helped enhance the SimCCS tool for large scale CCUS infrastructure simulations, advancing the United States’ leadership in carbon storage modeling.

Dr. Ma’s innovations in modeling and simulation have earned several honors, including Los Alamos National Laboratory’s SPOT Award. To date, he has published more than 34 peer reviewed journal articles and 26 conference papers, and has presented widely at international conferences and workshops. He has delivered invited talks and lectures at venues including the AGU Fall Meeting, The University of Texas at Austin, and Penn State University, and has mentored three postdoctoral researchers and more than ten graduate and undergraduate students. 

In addition to his research and mentorship, Dr. Ma plays an active leadership role in the international CCUS community. He is helping to organize and lead major conferences, serving on the program committees for CCUS 2025 and CCUS 2026, where he contributes to shaping the scientific agenda and fostering collaboration among global experts in carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
